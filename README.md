# GLBL 5010 — Economics for Global Affairs  
## Homework Repository (Kevin, Pranav, Lucy)

This repository contains code and outputs for group homework assignments in **GLBL 5010: Economics for Global Affairs**.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- store reproducible code with analysis primarily based in Pandas
- facilitate collaboration across our group
- maintain a clean, version-controlled record of work to be submitted for GLBL 5010

Each homework assignment is stored in its own subfolder.

## Homework 1: Examining Convergence

The analysis for Homework 1:
- constructs annualized GDP per capita growth rates (1960–2000)
- produces histograms, percentiles, and convergence scatter plots
- examines convergence patterns by region and by education quartile

All results are generated using Python.

---

## Data

- The dataset (`hwk1_convergence.csv`) is just placed into this repo
- The CSV file is expected to be located in the **same directory** as the corresponding ipynb.
- Missing values are handled explicitly and excluded from calculations where required.

---

## Software Requirements

The analysis was conducted using:

- Python 3.11
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

All code is contained in Jupyter notebooks (".ipynb").

---

## Reproducibility Notes

- All data cleaning steps are documented directly in the notebooks.
- Variables are converted to numeric types explicitly before analysis.
- Logs are only taken for strictly positive GDP per capita values.
- Summary statistics are reported to **two decimal places**, following course guidance.

---

## Collaboration Notes
- Commit messages should be concise and descriptive.
- No personal file paths or machine-specific information should be added to the notebooks.

---

## Submission

Final write-ups are submitted as **PDFs on Gradescope**.  
Code is appended to the write-up as required by the assignment instructions.
